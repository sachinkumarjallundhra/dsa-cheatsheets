    <h1>📚 Maximum Performance of a Team – Java Cheat Sheet</h1>

    <h2>📌 What Is It?</h2>
    <p>The <b>Maximum Performance of a Team</b> problem involves selecting up to <code>K</code> engineers from a pool of engineers, each with a given speed and efficiency, to maximize the team's performance. The performance is calculated as the sum of the selected engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among them.</p>
    <p>This problem can be solved using a <b>max-heap</b> to track the engineers with the highest speeds.</p>

    <h2>🧱 Pattern Template</h2>
    <pre><code>class Solution {
    public int maxPerformance(int n, int[] speed, int[] efficiency, int k) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        Engineer[] engineers = new Engineer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
            engineers[i] = new Engineer(speed[i], efficiency[i]);
        }

        Arrays.sort(engineers, (a, b) -&gt; b.efficiency - a.efficiency);

        PriorityQueue&lt;Integer&gt; speedHeap = new PriorityQueue&lt;&gt;();
        long speedSum = 0, maxPerformance = 0;

        for (Engineer engineer : engineers) {
            speedHeap.offer(engineer.speed);
            speedSum += engineer.speed;

            if (speedHeap.size() &gt; k) {
                speedSum -= speedHeap.poll();
            }

            maxPerformance = Math.max(maxPerformance, speedSum * engineer.efficiency);
        }

        return (int) (maxPerformance % MOD);
    }

    class Engineer {
        int speed;
        int efficiency;

        Engineer(int speed, int efficiency) {
            this.speed = speed;
            this.efficiency = efficiency;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

    <h2>📊 Time Complexity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Sorting Engineers</b>: <code>O(N log N)</code> – Sorting engineers by efficiency.</li>
      <li><b>Heap Operations</b>: <code>O(N log K)</code> – Adding and removing elements from the heap.</li>
      <li><b>Overall Complexity</b>: <code>O(N log N + N log K)</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>✅ Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimizing team performance in hiring scenarios</li>
      <li>Applications in resource allocation problems</li>
      <li>Efficiently processing large datasets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧪 Example: Maximum Performance of a Team</h2>
    <pre><code>Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
Output: 60

Explanation:
- Select engineers with speed [10, 5] and efficiency [4, 7].
- The maximum performance is (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.</code></pre>

    <h2>💡 Pro Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sort engineers by efficiency to ensure the minimum efficiency is always valid.</li>
      <li>Use a min-heap to efficiently track the lowest speeds among the selected engineers.</li>
      <li>Edge cases: fewer than <code>K</code> engineers, engineers with identical efficiencies.</li>
    </ul>
