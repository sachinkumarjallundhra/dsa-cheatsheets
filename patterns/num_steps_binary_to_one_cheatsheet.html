    <h1>📚 Number of Steps to Reduce a Binary Number to One – Java Cheat Sheet</h1>

    <h2>📌 What Is It?</h2>
    <p>The <b>Number of Steps to Reduce a Binary Number to One</b> problem involves reducing a binary number (given as a string) to 1 by performing the following operations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the number is even, divide it by 2.</li>
      <li>If the number is odd, add 1 to it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reduce the binary number to 1.</p>

    <h2>🧱 Pattern Template</h2>
    <h3>Simulating Binary Operations</h3>
    <pre><code>class Solution {
    public int numSteps(String s) {
        int steps = 0;
        int carry = 0;

        // Start from the least significant bit and process toward the most significant bit
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) - '0' + carry == 1) {
                // If the bit is 1 (odd), add 1 (carry) and increment steps
                carry = 1;
                steps += 2; // Add 1 and divide by 2
            } else {
                // If the bit is 0 (even), just divide by 2
                steps += 1;
            }
        }

        // Handle the most significant bit
        return steps + carry;
    }
}</code></pre>

    <h2>📊 Time Complexity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Time Complexity:</b> <code>O(N)</code>, where <code>N</code> is the length of the binary string.</li>
      <li><b>Space Complexity:</b> <code>O(1)</code>, as we use only a constant amount of extra space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>✅ Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulating binary operations efficiently.</li>
      <li>Understanding bit manipulation and binary arithmetic.</li>
    </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧪 Example</h2>
    <pre><code>Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6

Explanation:
- "1101" is odd, add 1 → "1110"
- "1110" is even, divide by 2 → "111"
- "111" is odd, add 1 → "1000"
- "1000" is even, divide by 2 → "100"
- "100" is even, divide by 2 → "10"
- "10" is even, divide by 2 → "1"</code></pre>

    <h2>💡 Pro Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulate the operations directly on the binary string without converting it to an integer.</li>
      <li>Use a carry variable to handle the addition of 1 when the number is odd.</li>
      <li>Focus on the most significant bit to determine when the process ends.</li>
    </ul>
