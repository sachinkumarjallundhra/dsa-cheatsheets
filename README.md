# DSA Cheatsheets

Welcome to my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Cheatsheets** repository!  
This repo hosts a collection of pattern-based cheat sheets to help me quickly revise common coding interview patterns with clean, easy-to-understand examples.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- **HTML-based Cheat Sheets** hosted on GitHub Pages  
  Live site: [https://sachinkumarjallundhra.github.io/dsa-cheatsheets/](https://sachinkumarjallundhra.github.io/dsa-cheatsheets/)  

- **Patterns Folder**  
  Contains individual pattern HTML files inside `patterns/` folder, e.g.  
  - `fast_slow_pointer_cheatsheet.html`  
  - `sliding_window_cheatsheet.html`  

- **Style and Layout**  
  Shared CSS in `style.css` ensures responsive design, mobile friendliness, and print-ready formatting.

## ✍️ How to Add or Update Cheat Sheets

- For HTML version, add new `.html` files inside the `patterns/` folder.  
- Update `index.html` to add links to new pages.  
- Maintain consistency in layout by using existing `style.css`.  
- For MkDocs version, add new Markdown files under `mkdocs/docs/patterns/` and update `mkdocs.yml` navigation.

## 🖨️ Print and PDF Tips
